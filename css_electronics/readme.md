# CSS Electronics OBD2 Monitoring Template

Provided by: [bonitoo.io](.)

This template provides a dashboard for [CSS electronics](https://www.csselectronics.com/) data example.

Want to deploy free, custom browser dashboards to display data from your CANedge devices?

The simplest bundle is the following:

* [CANedge1 (8 GB)](https://www.csselectronics.com/products/can-logger-sd-canedge1)
* [OBD2-DB9 adapter](https://www.csselectronics.com/products/obd2-db9-adapter-cable)

With this, you can log your own data from your own car to an SD card, which you can then extract to PC. Using the [Python script](https://github.com/CSS-Electronics/dashboard-writer) you can then decode the data and send it to your InfluxDB account for visualization through the template.
